        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup San Marzano tomato sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li>
            <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>2-3 fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>1-2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible (usually around 500-550°F or 260-290°C).</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, stretch the pizza dough out into a circle, leaving the edges slightly thicker than the center.</li>
            <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a 1/2 inch border around the edge.</li>
            <li>Arrange the sliced mozzarella cheese over the tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the minced garlic, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Spread this mixture over the pizza, avoiding the edges.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is puffed and golden brown, and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Top the pizza with fresh basil leaves.</li>
            <li>Slice the pizza and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
